    "**Tasks for the Next Period:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Read the following papers** to understand how simplicial complexes are applied, learn about contrastive learning, grasp its concepts, and understand the concrete steps to implement it:\n",
    "   - 1) *\"Node Classification in Networks via Simplicial Interactions\"*\n",
    "   - 2) *\"TopoSRL: Topology Preserving Self-Supervised Simplicial Representation Learning\"*\n",
    "   - 3) *\"InfoGCL: Information-Aware Graph Contrastive Learning\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Analyze each section of the papers**—understand the dataset characteristics, how the operations are performed on them, what the inputs are, and what the outputs are (node representations/graph representations/edge representations).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Study the code of SCHash and HGSketch**, align it with the papers section by section, and clarify the implementation details. **HGSketch will be your primary reference paper.**\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **After fully understanding the material**, explore whether **contrastive learning can be integrated into HGSketch** to enhance content representations and achieve better detection performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "**Key Focus:**\n",
    "- Deepen theoretical understanding of simplicial complexes & contrastive learning.\n",
    "- Compare datasets & methodologies across papers.\n",
    "- Code study with emphasis on HGSketch’s architecture.\n",
    "- Innovate by combining HGSketch with contrastive learning techniques."
